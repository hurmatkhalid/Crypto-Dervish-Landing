       answer: "Metamask is a crypto wallet that can store your Ethereum, and is needed to purchase and mint a Cool Cat. Having a wallet gives you an Ethereum address (i.e. 0xABCD….1234), this is where your NFT will be stored. Learn more about Metamask and how easy it is to use over here! (https://metamask.io/)"

       question: "Tokenomics?",
       answer: "We have reserved 100 cats to giveaway in competitions and holder airdrops. Most of these will be given out after launch and will not occupy the early token ids. The 4 members of staff have each been given a Cool Cat (not from the reserve pile). The remainder of the cats are all for sale."
