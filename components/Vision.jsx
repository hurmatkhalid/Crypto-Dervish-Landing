                <p>Crypto Dervish are much more than an NFT art project. We have plans and hopes to build a Crypto Dervish ecosystem comprised of interactivity and utility,
                    community rewards and growth, collaboration with brands, and much more! We want the community to help
                    dictate and determine which features we should be focusing on next - so you guys will be heavily involved in the future of Crypto Dervish!
